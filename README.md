# EngSci Tools Landing Page
This is the page that goes at the root of the domain and contains links to all the other tools we have created.
It is written in Vue.

## Development
Development requires `git` and `node` as well as either `npm` or `yarn`. For production, you need `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.
1. Clone the repository and navigate to it with `git clone https://github.com/EngSci-Tools/Landing-Page && cd Landing-Page`.
2. Install dependancies with `yarn` or `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `yarn serve` or `npm run serve`.
4. Edit the files within the `src` directory to change the website.
5. Edit the `server.mjs` file to change the backend and api.
6. Run `docker-compose up -d` to run the production server on port `5000`.
